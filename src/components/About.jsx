                    I’m a junior web developer with a background in sport sciences, and in 2023 I decided to completely change paths and dive into IT.
                    It was a big shift, but one that felt natural.
                    I’ve always been drawn to problem-solving, curiosity, and the satisfaction of finding solutions, and coding turned out to be the perfect place for all of that.

                <p>
                    What I discovered along the way is that back-end development is really where I thrive.
                    I enjoy tackling the logic behind applications, structuring data, and building systems that are both efficient and reliable.
                    There’s something deeply rewarding about facing a complex problem, breaking it down step by step, and seeing the result come to life immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I mostly work with Ruby and PHP, and I really like building projects with Ruby on Rails and Symfony.
                    I’m comfortable with relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL, and I put a lot of care into writing clean, maintainable code by applying principles such as SOLID, DRY, OOP, CRUD, ORM, and designing REST APIs.
                    These aren’t just buzzwords for me, they’re tools that help me build better, smarter solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What keeps me motivated is curiosity. Every new project is an opportunity to learn, experiment, and improve.
                    I enjoy exploring new technologies, trying out best practices, and figuring out how to make things not only work, but work well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is simple: to keep growing as a developer, contribute to meaningful projects, and collaborate with people who value creativity, efficiency, and technical excellence.
                    I see coding as a journey, and I’m excited to keep pushing forward, learning more, and solving new challenges along the way.
